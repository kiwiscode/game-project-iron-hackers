# Game Project

This project contains two separate games created using JavaScript, Canvas, HTML, and CSS: Space Strike and Guess My Number.

## Space Strike

Space Strike is an action-packed game where you control a spaceship and aim to shoot down drones. It features a background sprite that I designed myself, as well as player and enemy characters.

### Gameplay

- Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the spaceship.
- Press the Space key to fire and shoot down the drones.
- Avoid colliding with the drones to stay in the game.
- Press the "P" key or click on "Pause" to pause the game.

## Guess My Number

Guess My Number is a number guessing game. The computer selects a random number, and the player's goal is to guess that number

### Gameplay

- Use the number keys on your keyboard to make guesses.
- Try to find the number chosen by the computer.
- The game provides hints based on the player's guesses (greater or smaller).

## How to Run

1. Clone or download the project files to your computer.

git clone https://github.com/kiwiscode/space-strike

With this update, users can easily access the games by selecting their preferred game from the navbar on the `index.html` page after cloning the project. As always, feel free to customize the instructions to match your project's structure and layout. Good luck with your game project!

## Technologies Used

The "Guess My Number" game is built using the following technologies:

- HTML: Used for structuring the game interface.
- JavaScript: Implemented DOM manipulation techniques for interactivity, game logic, and modular code organization.

## Development Process

"Guess My Number" was developed during my JavaScript learning journey as a part of an online course. It served as a practical project to apply the concepts I learned and improve my coding skills. Through this project, I gained valuable experience in DOM manipulation, handling user input, and building interactive web applications.

Wishing you a fun and educational experience with this project!
